# 🌐 Revive – Revolutionizing Disaster Management

> A project by Team **Matrix Infinity** for the **Google Solutions Challenge**

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Disaster response agencies in India lack effective systems to gather and act on real-time data during disaster times. This inadequacy leads to loss of human life as well as irreparable damage. A Solution is required which enables rescue teams to communicate effectively even during disasters to save lives efficiently.

- Aggregates real-time data from social media, news, and public reports
- Enables real-time data transmission through emergency-ready communication nodes
- Provides rescue teams with a live dashboard to monitor and manage disaster responses
- Allows civilians to report events, request supplies, and send SOS signals during disaster
- Facilitates public donations and logistics coordination

## Getting Started


1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishaal19fl/revive-matrix-infinity
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd revive-matrix-infinity
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGO=your-mongodb-uri
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret
   ```

4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   yarn start
   ```
   
5. **Start the frontend server:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   yarn dev --host
   ```   

6. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Make sure to replace `your-mongodb-uri`, `your-cloudinary-api-key`, and `your-cloudinary-api-secret` with your actual MongoDB URI and Cloudinary API credentials. This will ensure proper functioning of the application.
